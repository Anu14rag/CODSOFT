# CODSOFT
In this repository I build 3 task which is given by CodSoft during my Internship these task are 1.TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION , 2.MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON , and 3.IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION


# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a data science and machine learning endeavor that aims to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. This repository contains all the necessary code, data, and resources to reproduce the prediction model and explore the Titanic dataset.

About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle. It comprises passenger information such as age, sex, class, fare, cabin, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, allowing us to train our models on known outcomes and validate them against unseen data.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data: Contains the dataset files (train and test sets) in CSV format.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation process.
src: Source code files including Python scripts that handle data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
results: Output files such as trained model weights, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.
images: Images and visual resources used in this README and the notebooks.
README.md: The document you're reading right now, providing an overview of the project.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd titanic-survival-prediction
Set up your Python environment (recommendation: use a virtual environment).
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter notebooks located in the notebooks directory. These notebooks provide a step-by-step guide to data analysis, preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the repository's code of conduct.



Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to Kaggle for providing the Titanic dataset and the data science community for their invaluable insights and resources.

Feel free to explore, learn, and enhance the Titanic Survival Prediction project. Happy coding!
