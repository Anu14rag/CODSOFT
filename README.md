# CODSOFT
In this repository I build 3 task which is given by CodSoft during my Internship these task are 1.TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION , 2.MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON , and 3.IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION


# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a data science and machine learning endeavor that aims to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. This repository contains all the necessary code, data, and resources to reproduce the prediction model and explore the Titanic dataset.

# About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle. It comprises passenger information such as age, sex, class, fare, cabin, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, allowing us to train our models on known outcomes and validate them against unseen data.

# Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

> data: Contains the dataset files (train and test sets) in CSV format.
> notebooks: Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation 
  process.
> src: Source code files including Python scripts that handle data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
> results: Output files such as trained model weights, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.
> images: Images and visual resources used in this README and the notebooks.
> README.md: The document you're reading right now, providing an overview of the project.


Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to Kaggle for providing the Titanic dataset and the data science community for their invaluable insights and resources.

Feel free to explore, learn, and enhance the Titanic Survival Prediction project. Happy coding!




# MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

The Movie Rating Prediction with Python project is an exploration into the realm of machine learning and predictive analytics. The primary objective of this repository is to build models that can predict movie ratings based on various features and attributes. This repository contains all the necessary code, data, and resources to reproduce the prediction models and delve into the fascinating world of movie data analysis.

# About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises a diverse collection of movies, each accompanied by features such as genre, cast, director, runtime, budget, and more. The dataset also includes corresponding user ratings, which serve as our target variable for prediction. By training machine learning models on this dataset, we aim to predict movie ratings with a reasonable level of accuracy.

# Project Structure
The repository structure is designed for ease of use and collaboration:

> data: Holds the dataset files in a structured format, usually CSV or Excel.
> notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks that guide you through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and 
  evaluation.
> src: Contains the source code files, including Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
> results: Stores the output files, including trained model weights, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.
> images: Houses images and visual resources for this README and the notebooks.
> README.md: You're reading it right now! This file provides a high-level overview of the project.


Start exploring, learning, and enhancing the Movie Rating Prediction with Python project. Happy coding!

# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic example of applying machine learning techniques to a real-world problem. The main objective of this repository is to build predictive models that can accurately classify different species of Iris flowers based on their features. This repository contains all the necessary code, data, and resources to replicate the classification models and delve into the realm of flower species recognition.

# About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of measurements of iris flowers' sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each entry in the dataset is associated with one of three Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. By training machine learning models on this dataset, we aim to develop accurate classifiers that can predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements.

# Project Structure
This repository is organized to facilitate ease of use and collaboration:

> data: Contains the dataset files, typically in CSV or Excel formats.
> notebooks: Hosts Jupyter notebooks that provide step-by-step guidance through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model 
  building, and evaluation.
> src: Houses source code files, including Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
> results: Stores output files such as trained model weights, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.
> images: Contains images and visual resources for the README and the notebooks.
> README.md: You're currently reading this document! It offers an overview of the project.


Embark on your journey of exploration, learning, and improvement with the Iris Flower Classification project. Happy coding!
